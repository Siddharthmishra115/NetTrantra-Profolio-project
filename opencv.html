                <p>This Project is about detecting faces from images.<br>Python has a libary known as OpenCV. OpenCV
                    (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
                    is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.The library has more than
                    2500 optimized algorithms, These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify
                    objects.<br><br>I imported this libary to the python
                    file and created a cascad classifier using .CascadeClassifer function of opencv
                    which will contain the features of face .Then opencv will read the image and it's features by using
                    .imread functions. Then detectMultiScale function is used to detect the face in the image and
                    display
                    it cordinates.<br><br>

                    <p>I did this project during my internship and it <br>took me 15days to learn about
                        opencv and build this project.</p>
